When I started the bash on windows command prompt this morning the font and scaling looked incredibly odd.

After looking through all of the information online, resetting the cmd.exe font and other settings. Was not able to fix the console. Eventually I was able to change it to a better font setting by editing the properties similar to below. Essentially I switched the font setting from Rastor to Lucinda Console and set a good font-size.

Feel free to leave a comment below if you have better ideas on how to get the fonts and displays to show up better for the Bash on Windows console window.
